// Therapist’s Office: Returning to the Present 

// (The scene cuts back to the therapist’s office. The camera zooms out from Peggy’s head, and we see the couple sitting on the therapy couch, both clearly drained from the argument. The therapist takes a moment before speaking, carefully choosing their words.) 

// Therapist (speaking gently but firmly):( RockyP1 Peggy P1) 
- "It seems like you both have very different perspectives on your relationship, but it’s clear there’s love here, even amidst the tension.” #speaker:Therapist #pigeon:PeggyP1 #rat:RockyP1
- “Rocky, you’re under a lot of pressure from your family, trying to provide for your community, and balancing that with your feelings for Peggy.”  #speaker:Therapist 
- "Peggy, you’re feeling neglected, not just by Rocky’s absence but by the differences in your worlds. You come from a life of privilege, and it’s hard for you to reconcile that with the life Rocky is leading. But that doesn’t mean your struggles aren’t real." #speaker:Therapist 
- "You’ve had to adjust to a world that doesn’t always feel safe for you. That’s a heavy thing to carry, isn’t it?" #speaker:Therapist

// (Peggy exhales through her beak, her voice comes out quieter, less performative.) 
// Peggy (softly, hesitating): (PeggyP3) 
- "Yeah… I mean, where I live, I have to be careful all the time. Dodging people, watching for stray dogs, making sure I’m not caught somewhere I can’t fly out of." #speaker:Peggy  #pigeon:PeggyP3
- "It’s exhausting. I’m always looking over my shoulder, always trying to figure out if I’m about to be someone’s problem just because I exist in their space." #speaker:Peggy

// Rocky (slowly, processing): (RockyP7) (PeggyP1) 
- "So… when you say I was never there with you… you don’t just mean you wanted company all of the time." #speaker:Rocky  #pigeon:PeggyP1 #rat:RockyP7
// (He pauses, choosing his words carefully, his voice quieter now.) 
- "You wanted me there to protect you… because you felt scared." #speaker:Rocky

// Peggy doesn’t say anything right away, but the way expression slightly tells him he’s not wrong.
// Peggy (softly): (PeggyP3) 
- "I didn’t always feel safe. And I don’t think I wanted to admit that." #speaker:Peggy  #pigeon:PeggyP3

// Rocky (murmuring, almost to himself): (RockyP3) (PeggyP1) 
- "I thought providing for you meant… making sure you had food, a place to rest, things you needed. I thought that was enough." #speaker:Rocky  #pigeon:PeggyP1 #rat:RockyP3
// (He exhales sharply.) (RockyP1)(PeggyP1) 
- "But I wasn’t there. Not really." #speaker:Rocky #pigeon:PeggyP1 #rat:RockyP1
// Rocky (softly, almost unsure): (PeggyP4) (RockyP6) 
- "I don’t want you to feel like that. Like you’re alone in it." #speaker:Rocky #pigeon:PeggyP4 #rat:RockyP6

// (The words hang in the air between them. Peggy doesn’t interrupt. She doesn’t soften it. She lets him sit with it. The therapist watches, allowing the silence to stretch before gently bringing the moment into focus.) 

- "See what happens when you hear each other? That’s the power of slowing down and taking the time to understand." #speaker:Therapist
- "But ultimately, the question remains: do you think you can keep building this relationship, or do you feel it might be time to go your separate ways?" #speaker:Therapist #pigeon:PeggyP4 #rat:RockyP4
// (PeggyP4) & (RockyP4)
- the end?
