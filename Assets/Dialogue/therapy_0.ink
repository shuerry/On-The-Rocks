- "Welcome, Peggy and Rocky. I’m so glad you both decided to come in today. Therapy is a big step, and it’s one that can help us explore how you’re feeling and what’s been going on in your relationship. Why don’t we start by sharing a little about how you two met? What brought you together?" #speaker:Therapist
- "Oh, it’s such a story. Classic city romance: boy meets girl, girl dazzles boy, boy sweeps girl off her claws with fried breadcrumbs and cheap carnival games." #speaker:Peggy
- "Cheap carnival games??? I’ll have you know I won you that plush donut. Took me three tries and, honestly, half my dinner money… took me as long as that scavenger hunt" #speaker:Rocky
- "Yeah, yeah, I guess you were kinda charming, huh?" #speaker:Peggy
- "It sounds like that first date had a lot of playful moments..those little gestures that build connection. And I heard there was a scavenger hunt involved?" #speaker:Therapist
- "Oh, yeah. I challenged him to find the perfect gift for me. Gave him ten minutes to prove his worth." #speaker:Peggy
- "No pressure or anything, right?" #speaker:Rocky
- "That sounds like a fun challenge." #speaker:Therapist
